Jarvis AI

A Python-powered personal desktop assistant

Jarvis AI is a Python-powered desktop assistant that responds to natural voice commands.
It can perform web searches, open websites, launch desktop applications, control system functions, and even speak with a bit of human-like hesitation (umm, uhh, hmm) for more natural interaction.

‚úÖ Voice Output

Speaks responses naturally with small fillers (umm, uhh, hmm, you know)
